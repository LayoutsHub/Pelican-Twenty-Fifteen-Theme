There are several ways to make money blogging, including: 

Advertising: You can sell ad space on your blog directly to businesses or use an ad network like Google AdSense. Advertisers pay to be exposed to your audience, so the more popular your blog is, the more you can earn. 

Affiliate marketing: Promote products or services and earn a commission on sales. 

Selling products or services: You can sell your own products or services, such as ebooks, online courses, or merchandise. You can also integrate an eCommerce store on your blog.

Sponsored content: Write sponsored articles for brands. 

Membership programs: Offer exclusive content to subscribers for a recurring fee.
 
Online services: Use your expertise to provide a paid online course, consulting, or coaching service. 

Podcasts: Produce a podcast and get a sponsor.

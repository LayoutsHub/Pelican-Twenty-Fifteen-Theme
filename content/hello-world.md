Hello World

How to Learn Data Science
Employment of data scientists is expected to grow 35% from 2022 to 2032. (BLS.gov)

So, how do you learn data science?

Let's discuss five reasons why most learning methods cause people to fail. Then, I will cover the correct learning method, which worked for me as I transitioned from a history teacher to a machine learning engineer.

Why do most data science learners fail?
High barriers to entry
Would-be data science learners often give up because they think learning data science is too expensive. Bootcamps and certification programs can come with huge price tags that scare people off. However, they may not realize that there are more affordable ways to learn.  

Boring curriculum
Affordable courses don't guarantee success. Many online courses contain dry video lectures or recordings of others writing code. This isn’t engaging, so learners end up tuning out. 

As a result, these courses have completion rates of 5% to 15%. Not great odds. 

Life gets in the way
Many data science courses have rigid schedules. Courses begin in a particular week, end in another, and may require live sessions at specific times. 

People who are learning online often have jobs, families, or other obligations. That can make keeping up with those schedules a challenge. 

The difficulty curve is off
If courses are too easy or too hard, most learners will eventually fall off the wagon. One common problem in online data science programs is that they’ve been built with pre-existing courses stuck together. One course might seem too easy, but the next is too hard. This happens because these courses weren’t built together.

Lessons don’t feel relevant
People tend to stick with their studies when they feel like they’re making progress toward their goals. But many data science courses are focused on lectures and drills, rather than doing real-world data science work. This can leave learners feeling like they are treading water. 

The right way to learn data science
Before I founded Dataquest, I taught myself the skills required to go from working in a non-technical job to working as a machine learning engineer. 

Through that experience — and through the experiences of the hundreds of thousands of learners who’ve gained data science skills on Dataquest over the last eight years — I’ve come to understand a lot about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to learning data science. 

And it’s all built into the Dataquest experience. 

Dataquest’s “learning loop”
For learners to be successful, we need to feel like we’re making progress. The importance of this can’t be understated. We need to feel like we can immediately use the skills we’re learning.

That’s why Dataquest is hands-on. You’ll be writing and running real code and working with real datasets from day one. 

In our side-by-side learning platform, you’ll read about a concept on the left side of the screen, then be challenged to write and run real code to apply what you’ve learned on the right side. 


This simple learning loop repeats through every single one of our courses. You learn something new and apply it to a real data science problem. Each screen builds on the previous screen and leads into the next one.
That means that as you’re learning, you’ll know you have grasped the material because you’re using it to do real data science work. 

You’re not watching lectures. You’re not filling in the blanks or answering multiple-choice questions. You’re writing and running code exactly like you will in a real data science job. 

Tailored course paths
An important part of this approach is that our courses are carefully sequenced to ensure no gaps. One course always leads to the next one, and each has a very specific goal in mind.

For example, here are some of our career paths:

1. Data Scientist
35 courses
26 projects

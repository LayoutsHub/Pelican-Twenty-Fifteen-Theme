Ollama Hack

With File Upload Forms (form demo) for Google Sheets, you can receive large files of any size from anyone directly in your Google Drive. You can automatically send email confirmations to notify the form submitter. The forms can be created inside Google Sheets using the built-in drag-n-drop form builder and the forms can have CAPTCHAs, collect e-signatures, multiple file uploads, password protection and more.


Unlike the file uploads feature in Google Forms, the form respondents do not require a Google account to uploads files through your form.


Receive Files from Anyone in Google Drive
A school teacher may want to build forms for students to upload assignments and the files are automatically saved to her Google Drive but in separate student folders. The HR team may want an online form where job applicants can upload their resumes in PDF or Word format. Business can build forms with eSignatures that respondents can sign on their desktops and mobile phones.


Google Forms do allow file uploads but the respondents need to be signed into their Google accounts before they can upload files. File Upload Forms impose no such limitations - anyone can upload files to your Google Drive. They may not have a Google account and they’ll still be able to use your Drive upload forms.
